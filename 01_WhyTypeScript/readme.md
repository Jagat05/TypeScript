# TypeScript Learning Notes (Setup → Compilation)

This repository contains my notes and practice code while learning **TypeScript**, starting from basic understanding up to compiling TypeScript into JavaScript.

---

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language built on top of JavaScript.
It adds **types** to JavaScript to help catch errors early and make code more reliable.

> TypeScript = JavaScript + Types

---

## Why TypeScript?

* Finds errors before running the code
* Makes code easier to read and understand
* Provides better autocomplete and editor support
* Useful for large and scalable applications

---

## Writing TypeScript Code

TypeScript files use the `.ts` extension.

Example:

```ts
let age: number = 20;
let name: string = "Alex";
```
Happy Learning 🚀
